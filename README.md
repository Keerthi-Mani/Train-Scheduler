## Overview

The objective was to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates the data with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Requirements

### App must suit these basic specs:
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes
* Calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

## Added Functionality
Form Validation for correct time input
